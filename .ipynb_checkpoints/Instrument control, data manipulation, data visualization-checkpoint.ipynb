    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "*Notebook author and repo contributor*: Jeff Damasco\n",
    "\n",
    "*Repo creator and contributor*: Hank Hinnefeld\n",
    "\n",
    "Hank has a couple examples on how to use his drivers, so you should look at those too. There are a couple of concepts that are not mentioned, like the use of object-oriented programming and the importation of various modules. I'll do my best to explain things further so that you understand just enough of the why; if there is something that is not clear, please let me know so I can improve this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, writing/typing out a complex program is much easier to read than decoding literal spaghetti code, which easily occurs in LabVIEW. There is also, of course, the issue of needing to buy and upgrade LabVIEW every year. The former is not typically a huge issue, though the latter becomes annoying when programs need to be updated yearly to stay compatible. Thankfully, Python does not need to be upgraded in the same way, and the upgrades that do occur typically will not affect the syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm hoping that this will make data acquisition, manipulation, and presentation/visualization a lot more transparent to the laboratory. There is still a lot of work to be done to control all of the instruments (like the magnet power supplies and temperature controllers), but for the most part, being able to control voltages & currents to obtain transport data should be well within the scope of these programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I'll be using: https://github.com/masonlab/labdrivers (originally written entirely by Hank Hinnefeld).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are drivers external to Python that we need:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. NI VISA\n",
    "\n",
    "2. NI DAQmx\n",
    "\n",
    "The `VISA` driver allows the computer to talk to instruments with GPIB. This should be ready to go for `Python 2.x` and `Python 3.x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DAQmx` driver allows the computer to talk with the National Instruments DAQ. This should also be ready to go for `Python 2.x` and `Python 3.x`. But be warned that the documentation for DAQmx suggest buil\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the main objective of Python is to act as another level of communication so that we can utilize the drivers to control the instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Contributing\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to contribute to the repo, you can send a pull request. This is particularly helpful if you want to build a wrapper class for a new instrument or if you want to modify features from an already-made class.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't feel skilled enough but still feel that you want to contribute, be on the lookout for bugs. There are a couple types to look out for:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compile-time errors** are simply errors where the script stops running because of bad input or because something was the wrong type or size (among many other problems!).\n",
    "\n",
    "*N.b. technically Python doesn't compile, it interprets*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Runtime errors** are when the script runs, but the output is not what you would expect. For example, if I expect that an IV-curve gives a linearly dependent and non-zero plot, but all the outputs are zero, there might be something in the script which was coded incorrectly yet stil within the bounds of what is acceptable to the interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find any of these problems, please let someone who is in charge of the repository know so that they can fix it, or create a GitHub account yourself and raise the issue on the repository page: https://github.com/masonlab/labdrivers/issues.\n",

Considering that, you might want to think about using the `with...as...` format, as that is usually faster than using `df.to_csv`. If you consider the number of records in your data, if you have an extremely large data set, then each time that you call `df.to_csv` will be more than the previous time, and that is actually quite inefficient.
